        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Element: a type of content.  They are enclosed in brackets.  Everything inside of an element includes the text from the opening tag to the closing tag.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser render correctly.  Elements here aren't visible.</li>
          <li>Metadata to include in the header includes:  style, base, link, metadata such as the character set, keywords, author, or viewpoint (which makes it look good on all devices).</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
            <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
            <li>external CSS style sheet:  preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
            <li>See prework module 3.2.3 for steps on how to set up a new style sheet.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.  For example color and blue.</li>
            <li>Property VS Margin:  property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
            <li>Additional CSS help <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model">here</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">here</a> </li>

          <h2>Git</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Git is a version control system.</li>
            <li>Commands always start with "git".</li>
            <li>Repository: a project folder that has all the files and history.</li>
            <li>Branch/Branching: workspace where you make changes that don't affect the live site.</li>
            <li>Markdown File (.md): the way GitHub files are formatted; plain text that converts to HTML.</li>
            <li>Commit Changes: saving a new version of a file; changes your branch, too.</li>
            <li>Pull Request/PR: asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch; discuss & review work with others.</li>
            <li>Merge:  when PR is approved, changes are merged with main branch; publish or deploy to live site</li>
            <li>Issue: a way to report a task or fix; track on project board; open for new issue then close when done. </li>
