# prework-study-guide

## Description

This study guide was created to provide a place to review important notes and to practice using basic coding. It is a "sandbox" to try out different techniques.  I have tried to implement my own changes such as adding additional images with their own styling, and by including hyperlinks to webpages with additional information to read later.

## Usage

To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
